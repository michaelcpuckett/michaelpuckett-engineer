                <h3>Spec</h3>
                <p>
                  Cards are arranged into two columns of equal height.
                  Consistent spacing is maintained between the cards, but the
                  cards themselves may grow in height to fit. Keyboard users
                  traverse the cards using the tab key, progressing from
                  left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
                </p>
                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p>
                  The challenge is maintaining equal height columns. CSS masonry
                  layout support is still experimental and extremely limited.
                  CSS multicolumn layout would place cards into columns and the
                  focus order would be top-to-bottom, left-to-right instead of
                  the intuitive order. With CSS flexbox, the focus order could
                  get muddled if a card in one column is much bigger than one in
                  the other column.
                </p>
                <h3>Strategy</h3>
                <p>
                  Starting with a CSS grid layout of 2 equal-width columns
                  ensures that the focus order is maintained even if JavaScript
                  is not enabled.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then, using JavaScript, calculate the heights of the cards in
                  each column. For the shorter column, evenly distribute the
                  difference in height relative to the other column among the
                  cards. Render the result with fixed heights and absolute
                  positioning. The total height must be applied to the container
                  since its children are all absolutely positioned. Recalculate
                  upon throttled window resize.

                <p>
                  Cards are staggered down the page. When a card is clicked, its
                  detailed view is revealed, with more information and shareable
                  links. On small screens, the detailed view shows as a modal
                  dialog. On wide screens, the detailed view opens to the left
                  of the main content, and the main content remains interactive
                  and independently scrollable while the detailed view is open.
                </p>
                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p>
                  The modal dialog is straightforward, but its relationship to
                  the view that opens to the left side and the mechanism for
                  transitioning between the two in a responsive manner are
                  unclear.
                </p>
                <h3>Strategy</h3>
                <p>
                  The detailed view that opens on the left side should be
                  considered a non-modal dialog, since it presents an additional
                  interactive context without inhibiting interaction with the
                  original context. As such, converting between the two requires
                  flipping the aria-modal="true|false" state of the dialog and
                  the inert="true|false" state of the main content.

            <h2 id="section-header-liveschool">LiveSchool app</h2>
            <p>
              LiveSchool is an app and website that helps educators manage
              student behavior by awarding behavior points and allowing students
              to redeem their points for rewards. (<a
                href="https://liveschoolapp.com/"
                target="_blank"
                >Live Site</a
              >)
            </p>

            <details>
              <summary>Realtime Event System</summary>
              <div>
                <p>
                  The LiveSchool app tracks student behavior in realtime using
                  Firebase, allowing educators to award points to students and
                  view their behavior history. If a teacher is logged in from
                  multiple devices, then the app synchronizes data instantly
                  across all devices. The use case was that a teacher would
                  award points on their phone and the points would increment or
                  decrement on a projected laptop screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My role was to key off of Firebase events and update the Vue
                  interface accordingly. The data was stored in Vuex, which
                  would be updated with mutations. The state changes would
                  trigger the interface to update.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Users came to expect that all aspects of the app experience
                  would update instantaneously across devices, including their
                  settings. For example, if a teacher changed the relative size
                  of the student cards, then the change would be reflected on
                  other devices. This required throttling the events to prevent
                  the app from becoming sluggish, while still maintaining smooth
                  animations. Moreover, the number of realtime events made the
                  app far more complex than it appeared on the surface, but the
                  overall experience was highly useful to educators.

                  The LiveSchool app is responsive and adaptable, ensuring a
                  seamless user experience that doesn't require learning
                  multiple interfaces when switching between devices.
                </p>
                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p>
                  The app must deliver a uniform experience across devices, from
                  smartphones to projected laptop screens. It showcases very
                  long or very short student names, along with their behavior
                  points; and features like student selection and viewing
                  behavior history. Interface components must be performant and
                  user-friendly, especially on touch devices.
                </p>
                <h3>Strategy</h3>
                <p>
                  Flexbox wrapping efficiently organizes elements, such as
                  student lists, adapting to varied screen widths. Text-overflow
                  elision prevents text, like long student names, from
                  overflowing by truncating it with an ellipsis ('...').
                  Breakpoints, applied selectively, adjust the design at
                  specific screen dimensions for optimal viewing and, in rare
                  cases, JavaScript is used to assess available display space.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Long, scrollable lists of students are virtualized, ensuring
                  the app runs smoothly, especially on older devices or slower
                  networks.

                  emphasized the crucial nature of UI parity between Marketing
                  and Online Store sections of the website, and positioned us as

                  For the September 2014 launch of the iPhone 6 and the new
                  Apple Watch, I worked under secrecy constraints, received
                  security training, and was placed in a sequestered office
                  alongside Marketing team designers, engineers, and PMs. I
                  prototyped and delivered the final version of what would
                  become the public's first glimpse at the Apple Watch.
