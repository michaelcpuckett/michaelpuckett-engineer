                <h3>Spec</h3>
                <p>
                  Cards are arranged into two columns of equal height.
                  Consistent spacing is maintained between the cards, but the
                  cards themselves may grow in height to fit. Keyboard users
                  traverse the cards using the tab key, progressing from
                  left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
                </p>
                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p>
                  The challenge is maintaining equal height columns. CSS masonry
                  layout support is still experimental and extremely limited.
                  CSS multicolumn layout would place cards into columns and the
                  focus order would be top-to-bottom, left-to-right instead of
                  the intuitive order. With CSS flexbox, the focus order could
                  get muddled if a card in one column is much bigger than one in
                  the other column.
                </p>
                <h3>Strategy</h3>
                <p>
                  Starting with a CSS grid layout of 2 equal-width columns
                  ensures that the focus order is maintained even if JavaScript
                  is not enabled.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then, using JavaScript, calculate the heights of the cards in
                  each column. For the shorter column, evenly distribute the
                  difference in height relative to the other column among the
                  cards. Render the result with fixed heights and absolute
                  positioning. The total height must be applied to the container
                  since its children are all absolutely positioned. Recalculate
                  upon throttled window resize.
                </p>

                <h3>Spec</h3>
                <p>
                  Cards are staggered down the page. When a card is clicked, its
                  detailed view is revealed, with more information and shareable
                  links. On small screens, the detailed view shows as a modal
                  dialog. On wide screens, the detailed view opens to the left
                  of the main content, and the main content remains interactive
                  and independently scrollable while the detailed view is open.
                </p>
                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p>
                  The modal dialog is straightforward, but its relationship to
                  the view that opens to the left side and the mechanism for
                  transitioning between the two in a responsive manner are
                  unclear.
                </p>
                <h3>Strategy</h3>
                <p>
                  The detailed view that opens on the left side should be
                  considered a non-modal dialog, since it presents an additional
                  interactive context without inhibiting interaction with the
                  original context. As such, converting between the two requires
                  flipping the aria-modal="true|false" state of the dialog and
                  the inert="true|false" state of the main content.

            <p>
              LiveSchool is an app and website that helps educators manage
              student behavior by awarding behavior points and allowing students
              to redeem their points for rewards. (<a

              <div>
                <p>
                  The LiveSchool app allows teachers to track student behavior
                  in real-time, synchronizing data seamlessly across devices.
                  For instance, when a teacher assigns points on their phone,
                  it's instantly shown to students via projected laptop screens.
                  This real-time approach extends throughout the app, including
                  to settings tweaks like visually resizing student cards.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Using Firebase web socket events, which were converted to Vuex
                  mutations, any changes would be instantly reflected in the
                  Vue-based interface. To optimize responsiveness, I employed
                  techniques such as throttling/debouncing, minimizing data sent
                  over the wire, optimistic updates, and providing visual
                  feedback when necessary.

                <h3>Spec</h3>
                <p>
                  Interface components must be performant and user-friendly,
                  especially on touch devices. The app showcases features like
                  student selection, roster selection, and viewing behavior
                  history.
                </p>
                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p>These lists can grow to thousands of items per school.</p>
                <h3>Strategy</h3>
                <p>
                  Long, scrollable lists virtualized using a recycler pattern,
                  ensuring the app runs smoothly, especially on older devices.
                  The entire list is virtually represented as JSON, but only a
                  subset is rendered in the DOM. This reduces the memory
                  footprint and the initial rendering time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The basic idea behind this pattern is to only render the items
                  that are currently visible on the screen. As the user scrolls,
                  items that go offscreen are "recycled" or reused to display
                  new content that comes into view. This way, the total number
                  of DOM nodes remains relatively constant and small, regardless
                  of the length of the list.

                  I spearheaded a significant re-architecture of the CSS
                  codebase for the Apple Online Store. I was entrusted with the
                  lead role for the three distinct phases of the project:
                </p>

                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Leading the core team, conducting research, sharing
                    knowledge, creating prototypes, and making pivotal
                    decisions.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Architecting the build system, envisioning the entire
                    pipeline, managing offshore work, and ensuring seamless
                    integration into our main codebase.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Creating a style guide and linter, and supporting project
                    teams with adoption.
                  </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                  As a team, we researched CSS patterns and
                  preprocessing/postprocessing frameworks. The ultimate decision
                  to adopt SCSS was strategic, aligning with the Marketing
                  department's tools and facilitating code sharing. This
                  emphasized the crucial nature of UI parity between Marketing
                  and Online Store sections of the website, and positioned us as
                  partners who could contribute to the ecosystem.

                  For the September 2014 launch of the iPhone 6 and the new

                  Marketing team designers, engineers, and PMs. I prototyped and

                  first glimpse at the Apple Watch.
