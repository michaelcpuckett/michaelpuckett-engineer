            <p></p>
            <p>
              I was born and raised in Louisville. I went to Manual High School
              and Western Kentucky University. I spent some time in San
              Francisco at Apple. I returned home and worked at Humana, and now
              I work remotely for Google.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most days, I like to stay home and watch movies with my partner
              and my dog (a medium-sized labradoodle). If I'm outside, I'm
              usually walking around the Clifton neighborhood playing Pokemon
              Go.

                <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
                <p>
                  Cards are arranged into two columns of equal height.
                  Consistent spacing is maintained between the cards, but the
                  cards themselves may grow in height to fit. Keyboard users
                  traverse the cards using the tab key, progressing from
                  left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
                </p>
                <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
                <p>
                  The challenge is maintaining equal height columns. CSS masonry
                  layout support is still experimental and extremely limited.
                  CSS multicolumn layout would place cards into columns and the
                  focus order would be top-to-bottom, left-to-right instead of
                  the intuitive order. With CSS flexbox, the focus order could
                  get muddled if a card in one column is much bigger than one in
                  the other column.
                </p>
                <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
                <p>
                  Starting with a CSS grid layout of 2 equal-width columns
                  ensures that the focus order is maintained even if JavaScript
                  is not enabled.
