                  I have an advanced understanding of ES/JavaScript, along with

                <p>
                  I am highly efficient working with React, Lit, Vue, Svelte,
                  and similar reactive MVC frameworks. I also have a solid
                  understanding of the DOM and other native web APIs.

                <p>
                  To accommodate all users, including those using assistive
                  technologies, such as screen readers or voice control, I
                  implement semantic markup, using ARIA where appropriate, and
                  follow best practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have worked on websites subject to legal action on the
                  grounds of inaccessibility. The code I wrote needed to pass
                  internal standards and external audits.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I adhere to WCAG in both letter and spirit, as I believe that
                  any set of accessibility guidelines stems from a universal
                  right to information.

                <p>
                  My educational background in graphic design allows me to
                  collaborate closely with designers and translate their intent
                  into code.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have led successful projects to standardize, componentize,
                  and document complex design systems for use by large
                  cross-functional teams. I've found that engineers can better
                  communicate with designers by building a living library of
                  reusable components that acts as a shared visual vocabulary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have also led successful projects to define and standardize
                  coding guidelines for large engineering teams.

                  I collaborate with UX designers to create delightful,
