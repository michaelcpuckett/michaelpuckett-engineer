          <p>
            I'm a creative technologist with over 10 years of professional
            JavaScript experience and an educational background in graphic
            design.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm a passionate advocate of digital accessibility, and I specialize
            in building accessible digital products and tools.

              <span slot="summary">Accessibility</span>
              <p>
                To accommodate all users, including those using assistive
                technologies, such as screen readers or voice control, I
                implement semantic markup, using ARIA where appropriate, and
                follow best practices.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have worked on websites subject to legal action on the grounds
                of inaccessibility. The code I wrote needed to pass internal
                standards and external audits.
              </p>
              <p>
                I adhere to WCAG in both letter and spirit, as I believe that
                any set of accessibility guidelines stems from a universal right
                to information.
              </p>

            <expandable-card role="listitem">
              <span slot="summary">JavaScript/TypeScript</span>
              <p>
                I have an advanced understanding of ES/JavaScript, along with a
                strong familiarity with TypeScript.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am highly efficient working with React, Lit, Vue, Svelte, and
                similar reactive MVC frameworks. I also have a solid
                understanding of the DOM and other native web APIs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although I specialize in client-side development, I have set up
                servers in Node.js and am comfortable coding for the backend.
