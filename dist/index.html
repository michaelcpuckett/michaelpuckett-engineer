          <p>
            I'm a creative technologist with over 10 years of professional
            JavaScript experience and an educational background in graphic
            design.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm a passionate advocate of digital accessibility, and I specialize
            in building accessible digital products and tools.

                <p>
                  To accommodate all users, including those using assistive
                  technologies, such as screen readers or voice control, I
                  implement semantic markup, using ARIA where appropriate, and
                  follow best practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have worked on websites subject to legal action on the
                  grounds of inaccessibility. The code I wrote needed to pass
                  internal standards and external audits.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I adhere to WCAG in both letter and spirit, as I believe that
                  any set of accessibility guidelines stems from a universal
                  right to information.

                <p>
                  I have an advanced understanding of ES/JavaScript, along with
                  a strong familiarity with TypeScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am highly efficient working with React, Lit, Vue, Svelte,
                  and similar reactive MVC frameworks. I also have a solid
                  understanding of the DOM and other native web APIs.

                  Although I specialize in client-side development, I have set
                  up servers in Node.js and am comfortable coding for the
                  backend.

                  I have architected the development of complex brand-wide
                  design systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have also led successful projects to define and standardize
                  coding guidelines for large engineering teams.
