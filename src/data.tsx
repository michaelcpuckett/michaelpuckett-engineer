            I am a strong advocate for accessibility and have a deep
            understanding of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). I
            have experience working with screen readers, voice recognition, and
            other assistive technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have worked on websites subject to legal action on the grounds of
            inaccessibility. The code I wrote needed to pass internal standards
            and external audits.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that any set of accessibility guidelines stems from a
            universal right to information.
