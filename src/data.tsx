            I am highly efficient working with React, Lit, Vue, Svelte, and
            similar reactive MVC frameworks. I also have a solid understanding
            of the DOM and other native web APIs.

            I have a deep understanding of the Web Content Accessibility
            Guidelines (WCAG). I have experience working with screen readers,
            voice recognition, and other assistive technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have worked on websites subject to legal action on the grounds of
            inaccessibility. The code I wrote needed to pass internal standards
            and external audits.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a strong advocate for accessibility and I believe that any set
            of accessibility guidelines stems from a universal right to
            information.

            My educational background in graphic design allows me to collaborate
            closely with designers and translate their intent into code.
